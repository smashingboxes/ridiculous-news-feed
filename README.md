# This is a ridiculous news feed

Much like pairing fine wine with synthentic cheese-like polymer spread or filet mignon with conveince-store brand crinkly potato chips, this news feed is at odds with itself. It will probably offend you if you look at it -- if you're not slightly offended at somepoint by looking at it, you're probably a shell of a human being. That said, the news feed is generated entirely by random coincidence, so don't blame us if you don't like it.

This news feed is built using the CNN Latest RSS feed, and does a search on Giphy.com for one of the words that lies within the title of each story. This makes every page load unique and totally uncontrollable, and thus we disavow any and all blame and or knowledge that it might do something unpleasant.

View, laugh, and enjoy solely at your own moral peril.
